Conversation 1 (Date: September 17, 2024)
Miguel:
"How's the satellite project going? You guys made big moves with the launch, mad props!"

Diogo:
"Damn‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt know bro had that dawg in him‚Ä¶ He joined STT recently and he is becoming one of the best hackers there. He also told me that he has a crush on a girl from there; he calls her Kiti tho‚Ä¶ not sure if she‚Äôs Portuguese."

Miguel:
"He‚Äôs doing good!"

Diogo:
"Well, about that, something‚Äôs been very sus lately‚Ä¶"

Miguel:
"Er‚Ä¶ what the sigma? What do you mean?"

Diogo:
"Well, one time I stayed at work a little bit late, doing some last-minute stuff, and I heard Virgolino (you might know about him, he‚Äôs that kinda weird dude) and Rafael Calhau talking about some mind control stuff and restaurants in Oeiras."

Miguel:
"I thought it would be nothing, but then I let out a sneeze. I looked at them, and they seemed terrified, as if I had overheard the most important thing ever, which made me very suspicious‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs probably nothing though, who would do such a thing?"

Diogo:
"Well, funny you mention that! Pombalino has been getting a lot more people than usual recently. Our boss even hired a lot of new people. (There‚Äôs this really beautiful girl now too, oh man‚Ä¶)"

Miguel:
"Stay on topic man!"

Diogo:
"Yea, yea! Sorry‚Ä¶ Anyways, you think people are being mind-controlled to go eat at Pombalino?"

Miguel:
"What‚Äôs next? Getting a girlfriend via mind control?"

Diogo:
"Get out of here."

Miguel:
"I just can‚Äôt shake that feeling that something‚Äôs wrong with the satellite."

Diogo:
"Look man, you know I never liked Virgolino. He was always up to something shady‚Ä¶"

Miguel:
"Remember when I caught him in a weird empty lot in Avenida de Ceuta? And then that whole weird situation with the Millennium Tower happened?"

Diogo:
"And now he‚Äôs involved in this‚Ä¶"

Miguel:
"Yeah, that was really weird, especially his weird meetings with the eyepatch guy‚Ä¶ he scared the shit out of me, not gonna lie."

Diogo:
"I did some research online about it and I found this DECO report; take a look at it."

Miguel:
"I mean, I never liked him."

Diogo:
"What do you think about the whole situation?"

Conversation 2 (Date: September 18, 2024)
Diogo Caseiro:
"This whole thing is very weird."

Miguel:
"Good point‚Ä¶ This is all becoming very suspicious."

Diogo Caseiro:
"Remember the legionella cases?"

Miguel:
"I don‚Äôt think anything has changed; if anything, people should be coming here less."

Diogo Caseiro:
"Do you have any ideas of what it might be?"

Miguel:
"Yeah, it doesn‚Äôt seem related to anything, at least that I know of."

Diogo Caseiro:
"So it‚Äôs real‚Ä¶ people really have been going to restaurants in Oeiras more often; it‚Äôs not just here at Pombalino too."

Miguel:
"Good luck man!"

Diogo Caseiro:
"Well, tonight I‚Äôm going to try to take a look at Virgolino‚Äôs computer. He usually leaves it on when he leaves at night, for some reason. See you."

Conversation 3 (Date: September 19, 2024)
Diogo Caseiro:
"Hey Diogo! You won‚Äôt believe what I just found."

Miguel:
"I managed to access Virgolino‚Äôs computer and found some shady things. There is a bank statement with a weird transaction for a 'MKU-2784'; I searched for it and seems to be linked to mind control!"

Diogo Caseiro:
"What‚Äôs up? You sound excited!"

Miguel:
"Yeah, but there's more, I also found the documentation of an API related to it and an email from Rafael telling him to execute some commands on it."

Diogo Caseiro:
"Are you serious?"

Miguel:
"I can barely believe it as well."

Diogo Caseiro:
"That sounds intense."

Miguel:
"That sound like a movie plot."

Diogo Caseiro:
"I get that it‚Äôs risky, but if it‚Äôs shady, it has to come out."

Miguel:
"I agree, but make sure that you have all the evidence you can."

Diogo Caseiro:
"Don‚Äôt rush it, this is not something to be taken lightly."

Miguel:
"I know, I‚Äôll be cautious."

Diogo Caseiro:
"Are you sure that‚Äôs a good idea???"

Miguel:
"I‚Äôll try to see if I can get something from Rafael as well."

Diogo Caseiro:
"Keep me posted, okay? üëç"

Miguel:
"Will do!"
